# PHP Warning: A non-numeric value encountered
This repository contains a simple PHP function that demonstrates a common error: comparing a numeric value with a non-numeric value.
The function `my_function` takes two arguments, `$a` and `$b`, and is supposed to return the larger of the two values.
However, it does not handle the case where one or both of the arguments are not numeric values.
This results in a PHP warning being thrown.
The solution demonstrates how to handle this type of error using type checking and proper error handling.
